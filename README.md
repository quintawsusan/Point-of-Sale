# POS (Point of Sale) API

A REST API for a small-to-medium retail business built with **FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL**. It manages inventory, customers, staff accounts, and sales.

## Features

* **Inventory Management** - categories, suppliers, products, stock, and pricing
* **Sales Processing** - sales, sale items, and multiple payment methods
* **Customer Management** - customer records linked to purchase history
* **User Access Control** - staff accounts with Admin and Cashier roles
* **Receipts** - unique receipt generated for each sale
* **Authentication** - JWT-based authentication protecting API resources

## Entities & Relationships

| Entity             | Relationship |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| Category → Product | One-to-Many  |
| Supplier → Product | One-to-Many  |
| Customer → Sale    | One-to-Many  |
| User → Sale        | One-to-Many  |
| Sale → SaleItem    | One-to-Many  |
| Product → SaleItem | One-to-Many  |
| Sale → Payment     | One-to-Many  |
| Sale → Receipt     | One-to-One   |

Foreign keys are enforced at the database level and validated at the API level, returning clear errors such as `404 Not Found` for invalid references.

## Tech Stack

* **FastAPI** - API framework and routing
* **SQLAlchemy** - ORM and database layer
* **Pydantic** - request/response validation
* **PostgreSQL** - database
* **JWT + pwdlib** - authentication and password hashing

## Project Structure

```text
app/
├── main.py
├── database.py
├── core/              # Security and authentication
├── models/            # SQLAlchemy models
├── schemas/           # Pydantic schemas
├── repositories/      # Database operations

└── routers/            # API endpoints
```

The application follows:

**Router → Service → Repository → Model**

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure PostgreSQL

Create a PostgreSQL database and add your connection details to `.env`:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://username:password@localhost:5432/your_database_name
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

### 3. Run the API

```bash
cd app
fastapi dev main.py
```

Tables are created automatically when the application starts.

### 4. Swagger Documentation

Open:

**[http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)**

Authentication is available through:

* `POST /auth/register` - create an account
* `POST /auth/login` - obtain a JWT access token
* `GET /auth/me` - view the authenticated user

Click **Authorize** in Swagger and enter the credentials to test protected endpoints.

## Error Handling

* **404** - resource or referenced foreign key does not exist
* **409** - resource cannot be deleted because it is referenced elsewhere
* **401** - authentication credentials are missing or invalid
* **422** - request data fails validation


## Running Tests

The project uses **Pytest** for automated testing. The test suite uses a separate **SQLite database**, so running the tests does not affect the normal PostgreSQL development database.

### Install Dependencies

Create and activate your virtual environment, then install the project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Complete Test Suite

From the root directory of the project, run:

```bash
pytest
```

To see more detailed test output, run:

```bash
pytest -v
```

### Test Coverage

The automated tests cover the main POS functionality, including:

* User authentication and authorization
* Users
* Products
* Categories
* Customers
* Suppliers
* Sales
* Sale items
* Payments
* Receipts
* Successful CRUD operations
* Request validation errors
* Missing resources and `404` responses
* Authentication and authorization failures
* Other key API failure scenarios

### Test Database

Tests use **SQLite** instead of the PostgreSQL development database. The test database is created and managed by the test fixtures, keeping the test environment isolated from the application's normal database.
You do not need to start PostgreSQL or modify your development database before running the tests.

### Running Specific Tests

You can run an individual test file:

```bash
pytest tests/test_product.py
```

Or run a specific test:

```bash
pytest tests/test_product.py -v
```

or run all the tests
```bash
pytest app/tests -v
```
